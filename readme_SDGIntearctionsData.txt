Data Overview:
There are two excel files which consist of the following:
Alldata.xls: This  excel file contains data collected for three independent methods used to develop the study. There are four sheets in this excel workbook. The first three sheet pertains to data collected for the seven-point SDG interactions score, correlation, and expert illicitation method. The last sheet is a derivative of the first three methods, which contains synthesized information of data.
Sheet overview:
method1: This sheet relates to the data collected through online expert survey using Kobo Toolbox. Description of columns:
institution -> institutional affiliation of the participant
inst_cat -> categorization of the institution into Intergovernmental Organization (IGO), Non-governmental Organization (NGO), Academia, and Government.
exp_years -> experience (in years) of the participant in the conservation sector of Nepal
sdgout and sdgin -> The SDG that the participant was randomly assigned to rate its outgoing and incoming interaction with SDG 15 respectively
outscore -> the outgoing interaction score assigned by the participant, consisting of values between -3 (Cancelling) to +3 (Indivisble)
conf_out -> the degree of confidence of the participant in their answer to the outgoing interaction score
text_out -> (optional) a description of why the participant gave that outgoing interaction score
inscore ->  the incoming interaction score assigned by the participant, consisting of values between -3 (Cancelling) to +3 (Indivisble)
conf_in -> the degree of confidence of the participant in their answer to the incoming interaction score
text_in -> (optional) a description of why the participant gave that incoming interaction score

method2: This sheet relates to the data collected for correlation analysis. This includes time-series data of SDG indicators for Nepal obtained from the Global SDG Indicators Database (https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/indicators/database/). Description of columns:
Year -> Year when the indicator was measured
forest_cover -> Forest cover as a percent of total area (%)
kba_freshwater -> Average proportion of Freshwater Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) covered by protected areas (%)
kba_terrestiral -> Average proportion of Terrestrial Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) covered by protected areas (%)
redlist -> Red List Index
undernourishment -> Prevalance of undernourishment (%)
food_insecurity -> Prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity in the adult population (%)
death_chronic -> Mortality rate attributed to cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or chronic respiratory disease (probability) 
suicide -> Suicide mortality rate (deaths per 100,000 population)
uhc_index -> Universal health coverage (UHC) service coverage index
f_parliament -> Proportion of seats held by women in national parliaments (% of total number of seats)
safewater -> Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services (%)
electricity -> Proportion of population with access to electricity, by urban/rural (%)
cleanfuel -> Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology (%)
renewable -> Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption (%)
gdp_capita -> Annual growth rate of real GDP per capita (%)
manu_value -> Manufacturing value added as a proportion of GDP (%)
consumption_gdp -> Domestic material consumption per unit of GDP (kilograms per constant 2010 United States dollars)
consumption_all -> Domestic material consumption (tonnes)
consumption_cap -> Domestic material consumption per capita (tonnes)
death_missing -> Number of deaths, missing persons and persons affected by disaster per 100,000 people
local_drr -> Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies (%)

method3: This sheet relates to the data collected through key informant interviews. We obtained the count of interactions by coding interview responses as outgoing or incoming co-benefits or trade-offs in MaxQDA. The sheet summarizes the count for type of interaction (co-benefit or trade-off) for each SDG.

allmethods: This sheet summarizes the proportion of co-benefits or trade-offs uncovered by each method for each SDG.

ForSynthesistable.xlsx: This excel file synthesizes goal level interactions for the three methods in three seperate sheets. We use this table to develop figure 6 of the Manuscript.
